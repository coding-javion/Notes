If we do not make any truncations in the possible sets of Slater determinants (many-body states) we can make by distributing A nucleons among n single particle states, we call such a calculation for

* Full configuration interaction theory

If we make truncations, we have different possibilities

* The standard nuclear shell-model. Here we define an effective Hilbert space with respect to a given core. The calculations are normally then performed for all many-body states that can be constructed from the effective Hilbert spaces. This approach requires a properly defined effective Hamiltonian
* We can truncate in the number of excitations. For example, we can limit the possible Slater determinants to only 1p − 1h and 2p − 2h excitations. This is called a configuration interaction calculation at the level of singles and doubles excitations, or just CISD.
* We can limit the number of excitations in terms of the excitation energies. If we do not define a core, this defines normally what is called the no-core shell-model approach.
* For Hamiltonian matrices of dimensionalities which are smaller than $d \sim 10^5$ , we would use so-called direct methods for diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix.
* For larger dimensionalities iterative eigenvalue solvers like Lanczos’ method are used. The most efficient codes at present can handle matrices of $d \sim 10^{10}$ .
